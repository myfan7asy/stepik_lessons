- setup and teardown are separate methods, not a fixture
- test and setup/teardown are enclosed in Class
- window size is set in a different way (for manual sample I made it as a part of setup/teardown method)
- actions (click, send keys) are done to web elements in the same lines (web element variables are absent)
- no assertions
- test actions are not separated with tabs as per Arrange/Act/Assert
